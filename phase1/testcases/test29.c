/*
 * The purpose of this test is to test when we join and our children have not
 * yet quit (ie we have to block).  The point of this test is to test behavior
 * when we are zapped while we are on the join block.
 * Expected output:
 * start1(): started
 * start1(): after fork of child 3
 * start1(): after fork of child 4
 * start1(): performing first join
 * XXp1(): started
 * XXp1(): arg = `XXp1()'
 * XXp1(): after fork of child 5
 * XXp1(): performing first join at this point isZapped() returns: 0
 * XXp2(): started
 * XXp2(): arg = `XXp2'
 * XXp2(): calling zap(3)
 * XXp3(): started
 * XXp3(): arg = `XXp3FromXXp1'
 * XXp1(): exit status for child 5 is -3
 * XXp1():at this point isZapped() returns: 1
 * start1(): exit status for child 3 is -1
 * start1(): performing second join
 * XXp2(): return value of zap(3) is 0
 * start1(): exit status for child 4 is -2
 * All processes completed.
