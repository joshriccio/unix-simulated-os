/* The purpose of this test is to demonstrate that
 * if we zap a process that has already quit but has
 * not joined, we return immediatly from zap with
 * status 0.
 * 
 * Expected output:
 * start1(): started
 * start1(): after fork of child 3
 * start1(): performing first join
 * XXp1(): started
 * XXp1(): arg = `XXp1'
 * XXp2(): started
 * XXp2(): arg = `XXp2'
 * XXp2(): exiting by calling quit(-2)
 * XXp1(): after fork of child 4
 * XXp3(): started
 * XXp3(): arg = `XXp3'
 * XXp3(): calling zap(4)
 * XXp3(): zap(4) returned: 0
 * XXp1(): after fork of child 5
 * XXp1(): performing first join
 * XXp1(): exit status for child 4 is -2
 * XXp1(): performing second join
 * XXp1(): exit status for child 5 is -3
 * start1(): exit status for child 3 is -1
 * All processes completed.
