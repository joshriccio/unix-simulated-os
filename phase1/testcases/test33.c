/* The purpose of this test is to demonstrate that

 * would be if it existed is occupied).

 * Expected output:
 * start1(): started
 * start1(): after fork of child 3
 * start1(): after fork of child 4
 * start1(): performing first join
 * XXp1(): started
 * XXp1(): arg = `XXp1'
 * XXp1(): zapping a non existant processes pid, should cause abort, calling zap(204)
 * zap(): process being zapped does not exist.  Halting...
