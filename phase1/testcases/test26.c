/*
 * The purpose of this test is to demonstrate that
 * an attempt to join by a process with no children
 * or no unjoined children returns -2.
 *
 * Expected output:
 * start1(): started
 * start1(): after fork of child 3
 * start1(): after fork of child 4
 * start1(): performing first join
 * XXp1(): started
 * XXp1(): arg = `XXp1'
 * XXp1(): performing join with no children
 * XXp1(): value returned by join is -2 expected value was -2
 * start1(): exit status for child 3 is -1
 * start1(): performing second join
 * XXp2(): started
 * XXp2(): arg = `XXp2'
 * start1(): exit status for child 4 is -2
 * start1(): performing third join, have no unjoined children
 * start1(): value returned by join is -2 expected value was -2
